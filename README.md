# LCS-Palindrome-Checker

## Overview
**MultiLCS** is a Python program designed to calculate the **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)** among multiple strings (up to 5 strings). Additionally, it checks whether the LCS is a palindrome and recommends the nearest palindrome word based on a provided file.

---

## Features
- Calculates the **LCS** for up to 5 user-provided strings.
- Checks if the resulting LCS is a **palindrome**.
- Recommends the **nearest palindrome** word if the LCS is not a palindrome.
- Saves results to a `results.json` file.
- Provides performance metrics such as execution time.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher
- A file named `palindrome.txt` containing palindrome words (for the nearest palindrome feature).
